# intro-to-R
 Here I collected some program assignments from R course on Coursera (R Programming by John Hopkins University).  
 I used R Notebooks mostly and knitted them to nice pdfs, all of which you can find in the coressponding assignment's folder.  
 The programming assignments were not very complex, but they provided a brief overview of the in-build R functions for data analysis and proccessing.  
   
   To give you a little understanding on what assignments were all about:
 * **Assignment 1** was focused on using popular statistical metrics, as mean or correlation coefficient, on large dataset, consisting of 332 csv-files
 * **Assignment 2** was more object-oriented and required to create special "matrix" object and to redefine matrix inversion a little bit. It is based almost entirely on provided example from https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2 
 * **Assignment 3** takes a deeper dive into sorting and subsetting the data frames. Also, some plotting and error handling were introduced.
